# MusicDownloader

##Download your music with python!

First thing first, all you need is a IDE like Visual Studio Code with python extension installed, and you need python either installed on your pc. 
After you installing the extension and python as well, you need to install two library on VS Code (Visual Code Studio).

On the terminal, the first command you will need to run is py -m pip install pytube to install pytube. 
After that, the second will be py -m pip install moviepy to install moviepy.

When the two is installed, you can run the code by writing his name on terminal with a py prefix, like py BaixarMusica.py.

The first thing he will ask you is to put a youtube link, you can copy one on the internet and paste on the terminal and then press enter. 
After he will ask you to put a directory to save the music, i recommend that you open the directory and copy the path on your explorer and then pase on the terminal. 

One thing that i need to clarify is, you cannot open file on VS Code, instead, open folder and then open the code by the explorer of the VS.

See ya!
